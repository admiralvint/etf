1. Create a new GitHub repository for your project.

2. Initialize a local Git repository in your project folder:
   ```
   git init
   ```

3. Add all files to the Git repository:
   ```
   git add .
   ```

4. Commit the changes:
   ```
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

5. Link your local repository to the GitHub repository:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```

6. Push the code to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin master
   ```

7. For deployment on AWS:
   - Create an EC2 instance
   - Install Python, pip, and required dependencies
   - Clone your GitHub repository on the EC2 instance
   - Set up a virtual environment and install Flask
   - Use Gunicorn as the WSGI server
   - Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy

8. For deployment on Azure:
   - Create an Azure App Service
   - Configure the deployment source as your GitHub repository
   - Set up environment variables for your Flask app
   - Configure the startup command to run your Flask app

9. For deployment on a classical FTP server:
   - Upload all files to your server via FTP
   - Ensure Python and required dependencies are installed on the server
   - Configure the server to run the Flask application (this may vary depending on your hosting provider)

Remember to update the `requirements.txt` file with all necessary Python packages before deployment.
